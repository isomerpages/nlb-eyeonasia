This book explores India through the eyes of young people from different parts of India, such as a Maoist rebel and a brother who killed his sister for marrying the “wrong man.” Young people like these, “driven by inspiration – and thwarted at every step by state and society” are “making new demands on India’s democracy for equality in terms of opportunities, dignity for girls and civil liberties.”

[**The Modi effect: Inside Narendra Modi’s campaign to transform India**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202849795){:target="_blank"}

When Narendra Modi went to the polls in 2014, his team used social media, the Internet, mobile devices and digital technologies extensively. Given India’s size, it was impossible for Modi to visit every city and village. The solution was to create a life-size hologram of him. Such pioneering techniques brought millions of young people to the polling stations and helped bring Modi to power.
