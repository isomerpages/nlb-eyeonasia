India has a large consumer market that offers abundant opportunities. It is set to become the world’s fifth largest consumer market worth around US$1.5 trillion by 2025. According to the Boston Consulting Group, India’s consumption expenditures is “expected to rise by a factor of three to reach US$4 trillion by 2025”. India’s nominal year-over-year expenditure growth of 12 percent is more than double the anticipated global rate of five percent and will make India the third-largest consumer market by 2025.” This growth is largely driven by rising affluence, with the number of those joining the elite and affluent segments of society expected to increase from eight percent in 2016 to 16 percent in 2025.[^18]

Of the 1.3 billion people in India, one-third of them are in the 15 to 34 age group. It means there are more than 400 million young people, many of whom are tech-savvy. Moreover, there are more Internet users among them than in the United States.[^19]

The Boston Consulting Group anticipates the number of people spending online to hit 300 million to 350 million by 2025[^20] thus providing huge opportunities in the realm of technology and e-commerce.[^21] Furthermore, the government hopes to grow India’s digital economy to US$1 trillion by 2022, but India’s tech firms are even more bullish by predicting that it has the potential to grow to US$4 trillion by 2022.[^22]
