Is China still the emerging market today as it is known? If yes, are we ready for an emerging China?

At the Eye on Asia programme held on 5 July 2018, one of the speakers, **Mr Lucian Koh, Managing Director of Singapore Success Stories**, asked participants if they were ready for an emerging China. Lucian’s career journey across industries such as manufacturing, trading and education gave him the opportunity to live in several cities in China like Shenzhen, Suzhou and Shanghai. Mid-way through his career, Lucian contemplated the option of either remaining as an employee or to take up the challenge to be his own boss. Eventually, he moved out of his comfort zone and became an entrepreneur.

Lucian shared insights on what it means to be an entrepreneur and included tips on what to look out for when exploring opportunities in emerging China cities. He highlighted the increasing use of technology such as WeChat for business interactions in present day China as compared to the early years of doing business in the country. The Chinese workforce is diverse with different Chinese dialects spoken across the vast country and being able to speak the Chinese language would be an added advantage too.

The second speaker, **Ms Shane Yeo, co-founder of Growthbeans,** shared that her experience with China began when her husband moved to its capital, Beijing for two years. As a trailing spouse, she desired to make her time fruitful and this inspired her to set up Growthbeans – a social purpose company that empowers individuals to be the change agent of their personal, community and organisational development for enhanced well-being and inclusivity.

Shane recognised the importance of cultivating networks and building relationships. She added that “there is always something to learn from people whom we interact or speak with”. Like the first speaker, Shane urged all to “move out of analysis paralysis” and step out of our comfort zones to meet new people, experience new encounters and take hold of new opportunities that may come our way.

As the famous Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu once said: “千里之行，始于足下” – translated as “a thousand-mile journey begins with a single step”. This quote shared by Lucian summed up the evening as participants were encouraged to persevere in their exploration of start-up prospects in China.

This is one of the talks under the Eye on Asia programme series for everyone including young Singaporeans who want to explore opportunities in the region and beyond.
