Eye on Asia launched its first monthly programme on 20 March 2018. We were treated to a special panel discussion where our speakers shared their experiences on living and working in ASEAN countries and China.

**Mr Benjamin Yong,** **Alumni from Temasek Polytechnic who interned in Vietnam, Ms** **Mae Ng, Assistant Vice President, Franchise and Global Operations, The Ascott Limited and Mr** **Wilfred Chua, Senior Manager, Business China** – each presented stories and interesting nuggets of their time in the region as well as what prompted them to take up these overseas opportunities. 

It was a cosy and informative session as participants learned from the speakers’ valuable first-hand experiences which were both very inspiring and insightful. 

This is one of the talks under the Eye on Asia programme series for everyone including young Singaporeans who want to explore opportunities in the region and beyond.
