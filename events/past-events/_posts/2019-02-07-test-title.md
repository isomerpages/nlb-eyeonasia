On 7 February 2019, both Dr Tan Chong Hui and Associate Professor Ding Ding gave an overview about the Blockchain technology and shared some of its impact on society today such as the key advantages and challenges. While Blockchain may generally be associated with the finance and banking industry, the technology and application are being explored for other sectors as well.
