“Keep learning – unlearn and relearn”, “be flexible”, “seize opportunities” and “do the groundwork” – these were some of the useful tips highlighted by Anselm Chu, Managing Director of the Singapore Cambodia International Academy (a wholly-owned subsidiary of SIM Group) during his talk on 16 August 2018.

Throughout the engaging session, Anselm shared about the business and career opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and pointers on planning for careers in China and Cambodia, as well as his insights on managing multi-country businesses based on his vast experience in regional roles in various MNCs in ASEAN countries and China.

**Opportunities in China**

The economic development in China is “fast and furious” and Anselm urged those interested in venturing there to visit the place to get first-hand knowledge from the ground. He mentioned that since Singapore carries a good branding, the opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative are vast for Singaporeans. He further noted that social commerce is the current rage in China and hence encouraged people to capitalise on the lucrative opportunities presented by this sector.

**Opportunities in Cambodia**

Anselm highlighted that the under-30 young population segment in Cambodia provides a huge market for education services. After extensive groundwork, his team found that the international school landscape was ripe in Cambodia and was thus instrumental in setting up the Singapore Cambodia International Academy there. Additionally, the young population, growing property market and rising tourist arrivals make Cambodia a key business player in ASEAN.

This is one of the talks under the Eye on Asia programme series for everyone including young Singaporeans who want to explore opportunities in the region and beyond.
