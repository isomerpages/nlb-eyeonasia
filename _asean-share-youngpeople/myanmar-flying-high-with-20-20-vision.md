*“Travel, petrochemicals, online shopping, charity, food and more… you name it and Mike Than Tun Win has a finger in that particular slice of pie.*

*After all, the serial entrepreneur has started as many companies as he has spent years (around eight) in the business world. Today, he owns eight companies across Singapore, Thailand and Myanmar with a total valuation of S$40 million and total headcount of about 700.*

*Most recently, he made headlines around the region when his online travel portal flymya.com took flight. Launched last June, flymya.com touts itself as the first one-stop site that allows travelers to compare flight schedules and fares across Myanmar’s 10 domestic airlines…*

*Says the 30-year-old: “To be a good entrepreneur, you need to be in constant pursuit of new knowledge – speak to people around you, travel around, and read as much as possible.”*
