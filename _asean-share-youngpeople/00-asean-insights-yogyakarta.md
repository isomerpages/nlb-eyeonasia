Thirty participants took part in a 4-day trip to Yangon in 2017, organised by Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Continuing Education and Training (CET) Academy as part of its Travel and Learn programme. The trip programme included business dialogue sessions, networking sessions with business leaders, local businessmen and Singaporeans residing in Yangon, and site visits.

In one of the business dialogue sessions, Mr Jovi Seet, Senior Executive Director of PwC Myanmar and Partner PwC Singapore, shared about the financial aspects of setting up a business in Myanmar, which is a cash-based economy. In another session, Mr Thomas Chan, Executive Director, KPMG Advisory (Myanmar) Ltd, shared his personal experiences on working in Yangon and highlighted the importance of commitment when working and doing business in the city.

Participants visited Kanaung Hub, a co-working space and incubation centre similar to the Silicon Valley, where they had the opportunity to network with the local IT start-ups from Kanaung Hub. Another site visit was made to Impact Hub Yangon, a global network social enterprise community centers, business incubators and innovation labs, where a networking session with social innovators was held.
