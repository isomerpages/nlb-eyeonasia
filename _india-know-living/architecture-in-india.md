[**The vanishing stepwells of India**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202864681){:target="_blank"}

Stepwells – ancient water stores – which are found below ground are unique to India. Built from around the third century throughout the country, particularly in the arid western regions, these stepwells also served as places where villagers could socialise and for travellers to take refuge from the heat. Journalist Victoria Lautman first encountered stepwells three decades ago and is now devoted to document these fascinating, but largely unknown, edifices before they disappear.
