[**Banking and financial markets in India: 1947-48 to 2019-20**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204007542){:target="_blank"}

This book traces developments in the banking sector and financial markets in India since Independence in 1947. It covers the nationalisation of commercial banks in 1969 and 1980, and sector reforms in the 1990s. The process of transition has been largely disruption-free, accommodating the unique features of the existing system while trying to align with the best international practices. This supported the transition of the Indian economy to a higher growth path, while significantly improving the stability of the financial system.
