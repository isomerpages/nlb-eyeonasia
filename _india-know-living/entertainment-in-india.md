[**Lineage of loss: Counternarratives of North Indian music**](https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/3550672){:target="_blank"}

In the mid-19th century, a new family of musicians emerged in the royal court of Lucknow and rose to the heights of renown throughout North India. Today this musical lineage, or ghar n, lives on in the music and memories of only a small handful of descendants and players of the family instrument, the sarod. The author explores the oral history and written records of the Lucknow ghar n, tracing its displacement, loss of prestige and erasure from the collective memory. An interdisciplinary, postmodern counter-history, *Lineage of Loss* offers a new and unsettling narrative of Hindustani music’s encounter with modernity.
