[**The vanishing stepwells of India**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202864681){:target="_blank"}

Stepwells – ancient water stores – which are found below ground are unique to India. Built from around the third century throughout the country particularly in the arid western regions, these stepwells also serve a place where villagers could socialise and for travellers to take refuge from the heat. Journalist Victoria Lautman first encountered stepwells three decades ago and is now devoted to document these fascinating but largely unknown edifices before they disappear.

This title documents the new private sector partnerships and practices that are transforming India’s built environment and presents how India’s land is rapidly transforming from a site of agricultural and industrial production to an international finance resource.
