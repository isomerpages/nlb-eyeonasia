The annual China Learning Journey for selected Business China Singapore Youth Chapter (BCYC) members serves as an effective platform for youths to gain holistic and in-depth understanding of contemporary China. In December 2017, 17 BCYC members embarked on a nine-day Learning Journey to various cities in China including Xiamen, Shanghai and Suzhou. This trip incorporated cultural and corporate visits to expose young Singaporeans to the changing face of Chinese society and to allow them to gain insights on China’s business environment. It also created invaluable opportunities for BCYC members to build friendships and networks with professionals that serve as the basis for future collaborations.
