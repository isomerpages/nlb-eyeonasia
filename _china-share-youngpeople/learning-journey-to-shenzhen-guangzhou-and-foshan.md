The annual China Learning Journey for selected Business China Youth Chapter (BCYC) members serves as an effective platform for youths to gain holistic and in-depth understanding of contemporary China.

*From 7 to 14 December 2019, 19 Business China Youth Chapter (BCYC) members embarked on an 8-day learning journey to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) where they explored the cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Foshan.* 

*Accompanied by the winning team from Business China Youth Showdown 2019, they visited a diverse set of companies ranging from traditional industries such as manufacturing and real estate to new emerging economies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Participants had the privilege of learning the business models, best practices of these corporations and gaining valuable insights on how Singapore may tap on the region’s exceptional growth to enhance bilateral partnerships and cooperation.*
