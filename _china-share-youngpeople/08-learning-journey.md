The annual China Learning Journey for selected Business China Youth Chapter (BCYC) members serves as an effective platform for youths to gain holistic and in-depth understanding of contemporary China.

From 15 to 23 December 2018, 18 BCYC members embarked on a 9-day China Learning Journey to Qingdao, Jinan and Beijing. This trip incorporated cultural and corporate visits to expose young Singaporeans to the changing face of Chinese society and to allow them to gain insights on China’s business environment. It also created invaluable opportunities for BCYC members to build friendships and networks with professionals that serve as the basis for future collaborations.
