*Business China organised the second Youth Series titled “Understanding the Modern History of Singapore and China through the ‘Story of Yanxi Palace’ and ‘The Little Nyonya’” via Zoom on the evening of 20 July 2020.*

*The invited speakers of the session were Mr Sim Sihan, President of Qing History Society (Singapore) and Dr Koh Chin Yee, Vice President of South Seas Society (Singapore). The session was moderated by Ms Lin Ziqi, Director of Operations of Business China Youth Chapter.*

*The Youth Series focuses on the history of Singapore and China based on the recent famous dramas “Story of Yanxi Palace” and “The Little Nyonya”. Over 140 participants, including Business China Youth Chapter members, students, young working adults and teachers had the opportunity to learn about the wave of Chinese emigration to Southeast Asia in the late Qing Dynasty, as well as the bilateral exchanges between Singapore and China over the years.*

*Mr Sim provided an overview of the Qing Dynasty and the dynamics of relationships in the palace. He also highlighted how drama series such as the Yanxi Palace offer viewers a glimpse of history even though some portions might have been romanticised. Dr Koh Chin Yee shared about the brief history of the Nyonya and Baba and how the Peranakan culture has integrated into Singaporeans’ lives. He also pointed out the Peranakan heritage of several Singapore's prominent figures who played important roles in Singapore's history.*
