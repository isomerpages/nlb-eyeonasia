*Ms Mae Ng was 23 when she first moved to China to work. During the 10 years when she was formerly with The Ascott Limited (Ascott), she lived in four different cities across the country. Mae, who currently oversees operations for faculties and student accommodation with one of Singapore’s top tertiary institutions, shares the lessons she has learnt from her stay in China.*

“I was 23 years old when I first moved to China to work. I remember feeling super excited; yet apprehensive at the same time. Navigating the sprawling city without getting lost and speaking Chinese in a way that the locals can understand were two of the initial hurdles that I had to quickly overcome.”*

“Network extensively and set up a mini support system so that you can adjust to life in China in the shortest possible time.”*
