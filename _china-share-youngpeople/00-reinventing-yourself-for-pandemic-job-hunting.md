In light of the multitude and velocity of changes observed in different facets of society due to COVID-19, OSG, Singapore Students' Association (Beijing) and Fudan University Singapore Students Association (FUSSA) have jointly organised an online forum series "Overcoming COVID-19: Singapore's Strategy to Survive and Thrive in the New Normal" to address these issues. 

The second forum in the series, titled ‘Reinventing Yourself for Pandemic Job Hunting’, took place via Zoom on 16 May 2020. It explored the key competencies employers look out for and practical advice on how to rebrand yourself for the market. Three speakers were featured:

·     Serena Troung (Sr. Dir., HR, APAC & Japan)

·     Jesher Loi (Dir., Branding & Market Devt., Ya Kun International) 

·     Frank Koo (Head of Asia, Talent & Learning Solutions, LinkedIn)

The forum was moderated by Yuki Chong (Peking University, World History) and Sophia Huang (Fudan University, Chinese Language & Literature).

This e-Forum series is also supported by the National Library, Singapore.
