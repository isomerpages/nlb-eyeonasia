For the first time in two years, the Business China Youth Chapter (BCYC) organised a Summer China Learning Journey, with Xi’an being the chosen city. Across the five days between 9 and 13 June 2018, the 11-member BCYC delegation learnt how history and innovation are integrated and embodied in the ancient capital city of China as they visited corporations, key cultural sites and gained the opportunities to interact with both Singaporean and Chinese counterparts…

The most significant takeaway for the entire delegation is that to thrive in a foreign environment requires one to possess perseverance and the ability to cope with constant changes…

The BCYC members also benefited immensely from the interaction sessions and the invaluable connections formed with Chinese students and business leaders.
