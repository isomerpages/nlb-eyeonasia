*Upon reaching Yangshan Port, we were astounded by the sheer size of it. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to understand that the port is only in its Phase 3. We were then brought on a short tour about the growth of the Yangshan Port over the years to what it is today.*

*It was very fascinating to visit Yangshan Deepwater Port as several of us have researched about it before for school assignments. As the world’s leading port, Yangshan Deepwater Port mainly serves China and neighbouring countries whilst competing with Korean and Japanese ports. Strategically located further out off the coast, the gateway port has depths deeper than 15m, allowing the biggest vessels to call safely. Over 90% of throughputs to hinterland are China’s import and export.*

*The journey to Yangshan Port is a rather long one. The colossal port was borne off the coast of Shanghai, connected by the 32.5km long Donghai Bridge that was architecturally designed to curb the choppy currents of the waters. Currently, the bridge allows truck traffic into its hinterlands. However, with the upcoming expansions of Yangshan port, further construction may be required to include railways along the Donghai Bridge.*

*Yangshan Port is to serve as a hub to spoke ports along the Yangtze River Delta, which give access to the fastest-growing areas along the Yangtze River. Additionally, Phase 4 is expected to be completed this year to be the biggest automated terminal with an estimated throughout of 6.3 million TEUs. It also complements the Shanghai Free Trade Zone programme.*
