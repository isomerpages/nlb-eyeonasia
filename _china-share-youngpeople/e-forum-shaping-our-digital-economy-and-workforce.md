In light of the multitude and velocity of changes observed in different facets of society due to COVID-19, OSG, Singapore Students' Association (Beijing) and Fudan University Singapore Students Association (FUSSA) jointly organised an online forum series "Overcoming COVID-19: Singapore's Strategy to Survive and Thrive in the New Normal" to address these issues. 

The first forum in the series themed 'The New Normal: Shaping our Digital Economy and Workforce’ was held via Zoom on 25 April 2020. During the forum, Mr Richard Tan (CEO of InnoSpace) shared about how companies could rise above adversity during COVID-19, while Mr Rudy Lim (Ventures Partner of Blockchain Founders Fund and former Head of Fintech DBS) focused on how Singapore companies can adapt to digitalisation.

This e-Forum series is also supported by the National Library, Singapore.
