Climbing from being the 12th largest economy in 2008 to the 7th largest in 2015, India’s growth in the past decade has often been cited as a natural counter-weight to China. Using extensive data to support his analysis, the author explores the paradox of a “premature superpower” (as Martin Wolf once described India in the *Financial Times*), and considers the social, economic and political forces that helped the rise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as the risks of constitutional liberalism yielding space to an illiberal democracy.
