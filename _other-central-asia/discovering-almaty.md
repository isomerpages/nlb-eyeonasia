Following the collapse of socialism, the cities featured in this book, including Almaty, have undergone changes in their outward appearance, functional composition and symbolic representation. “They have been shattered and reassembled by new political forces and market economies. Yet, the legacy of socialist urban planning and imagination has neither just disappeared, nor did it come to coexist peacefully with the new.” This book explores these transformations from a variety of perspectives.
