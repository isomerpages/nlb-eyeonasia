[**The idea of Gujarat: History, ethnography and text**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=13867172){:target="_blank"}

This work critically examines the processes that went into the formation of the region and, in doing so, unsettles a series of conventional wisdom about the land and its inhabitants. Individual chapters explore the work of courts, colonial officers, politicians, scholars, and gods and goddesses in the making of the state. The book provides a broad introduction to the idea of Gujarat, the scope of its history, the nature of its politics, and the dynamics of its society.

*The Making of Miracles in Indian States* studies three growth miracles in India at the state-level – Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat. These are three of the largest and most diverse states in India and have grown at rates exceeding 8 percent for an entire decade. These “miracles” can be partly attributed to visionary leaders such as Chandrababu Naidu, Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi.

[**India economy: Gujarat set to drive the government’s push for competition**](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/Main/Browse?startsWith=P){:target="_blank"}

Gujarat is one of India’s most industrialised regions and arguably its most business-friendly state. For much of India’s post-1990 economic reform period, Gujarat’s economy has grown at rates similar to the East Asian tigers. Comprising less than 5 percent of India’s total population, Gujarat’s economic development strategy has focused on cutting red tape, facilitating land acquisition, as well as providing infrastructure and public goods.
