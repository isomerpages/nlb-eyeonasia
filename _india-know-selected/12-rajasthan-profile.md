### **Introduction**

Rajasthan is located in northwestern India, bounded on the west and northwest by Pakistan and shares domestic borders with the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. With a land area of 342,239 sq km, Rajasthan is the largest state in India geographically.[^8] The state is divided into 33 districts and comprises nine regions – Ajmer State, Hadoti, Dhundhar, Gorwar, Shekhawati, Mewar, Marwar, Vagad and Mewat.[^9]

The western part of Rajasthan is relatively dry and infertile. Rajasthan is home to the Thar Desert, also known as the Great Indian Desert, and the Chambal River, which is solely responsible for the water supply in the region.[^10] Jaipur, Udaipur, Kota and Ajmer are known as the four smart cities in Rajasthan.[^11]



### **Demographic Profile**

In 2011, the population in Rajasthan was 68.5 million. The population grew 21.2 percent from the 56.5 million recorded in 2001. The population of males outnumbered that of females: in 2011, the gender ratio was 0.928 female to one male.[^12] In 2011, 45.57 percent of workers in Rajasthan were cultivators, 17.53 percent were agricultural labourers and 2.41 percent were employed in the household industry. In the same year, the state had a literacy rate of 66.1 percent, work participation rate of 43.6 percent and a population density of 200 persons per sq km.[^13]




### **Economy profile**

Rajasthan’s estimated gross state domestic product (GSDP) for 2016–2017 was Rs 759,235 crore, a growth of 11.04 percent from the previous year. In 2015–2016, the state achieved a GSDP of Rs 683,758 crore and grew 11.05 percent. The per capita income for 2016–2017 was Rs 92,076. This is an increase of 9.64 percent compared with the Rs 83,977 achieved in 2015–2016.[^14]

Agriculture accounted for 25.5 percent of total output in 2016–2017. The industries sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services, and construction, contributed 28.38 percent, while the services sector contributed 46.12 percent.[^15]

 

### **Industries**

**Agriculture**

Agriculture is an important sector in Rajasthan. It forms the backbone of the state’s economy and is a significant contributor to the GSDP. The state has been implementing several programmes to ensure growth in agricultural production and to provide better living conditions to the population who engage in agricultural and allied activities. Rajasthan is the highest producer of mustard, gram and bajra (millet) in India.[^16]


**Mining and minerals**

Rajasthan boasts huge mineral reserves. It produces 79 varieties of minerals such as wollastonite, lead, zinc, calcite, gypsum, rock phosphate, silver, marble, sandstone and serpentine (green marble).[^17]


**Cement**

Rajasthan has one of the highest limestone reserves, making it a hub for industries such as cement production. The state is one of the largest producers of cement grade limestone and steel grade limestone in India, and the largest producer in the northern and western parts of India. With 24 major cement plants, Rajasthan produces more than 44 million tonnes of limestone per annum.[^18]


**Renewable energy**

Two key factors that contribute to Rajasthan’s favourable solar energy production are its high level of solar radiation and large tracts of relatively flat and undeveloped land.[^19] As at January 2018, Rajasthan’s total installed power generation capacity was 20,954.54 megawatt (MW).[^20]



### **Tourism**

Rajasthan is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in India. Its palaces and forts are major attractions that draw many tourists to the state each year. Behind each palace and fort is a riveting story about its kings, their kingdoms and the colourful culture of Rajasthan. Six of the forts – Chittorgarh Fort, Kumbhalgarh Fort, Ranthambhore Fort, Gagaron Fort, Amber Fort and Jaisalmer Fort – were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2013.[^21]

Rajasthan also attracts tourists with its fairs and festivals, handicrafts, heritage hotels, adventure tourism, rural and eco-tourism, religious tourism and temple architecture. In recent years, the state has made significant efforts to develop and boost tourism. In 2017, Rajasthan received 1.61 million visits from foreign tourists.[^22]

 

### **Singapore and Rajasthan**

In October 2016, IE Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Rajasthan to “facilitate collaboration between Singapore and Rajasthan companies in smart urban solutions and tourism development.” This provides opportunities for Singapore companies that are seeking to expand overseas, particularly in these two sectors.[^23]

In the same month, a tourism skills training centre was also launched in Udaipur by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The curriculum for the Centre of Excellence for Tourism Training is prepared by Singapore’s Institute of Technical Education Services. The centre offers up to six courses including retail services, hospitality operations and culinary arts, with an annual intake of 480 students.[^24]
