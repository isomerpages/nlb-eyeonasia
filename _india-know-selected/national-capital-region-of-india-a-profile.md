### **Introduction**

The National Capital Region (NCR) of India is one of the world’s largest urban agglomerations.[^8] It is a unique example of inter-state regional planning and development, covering the entire National Capital Territory of Delhi, the 13 districts of the State of Haryana, seven districts of the State of Uttar Pradesh and two districts of the State of Rajasthan, with the nation’s capital, New Delhi, as its core.[^9] The NCR and associated NCR Planning Board were created in 1985 to plan the development of the region as well as enact harmonised policies for the control of land use and development of infrastructure in the region, so as to avoid any haphazard development of the region.[^10] The NCR Planning Board’s Regional Plan 2021 aims to promote economic growth and develop the entire NCR as a region of global excellence.[^10]

### **Economic profile**

Over the past decade, the NCR has emerged as one of the foremost economic centres in India. It contributes significantly to India’s growth, accounting for about 7 to 8 percent of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP).[^12] Delhi is one of the fastest growing states in the country with an estimated Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of US$ 123.90 billion in 2021-22. The state’s GSDP increased at a CAGR of 8.89 percent between 2015-16 and 2021-22.[^13]

The government of Delhi is committed to creating a progressive business environment. As per the new Industrial Policy for Delhi 2010-21, the government is keen on developing and promoting the high-tech, and knowledge-based IT and ITeS (information technology enabled services) industries in the state.[^14]

According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), inflows of direct foreign investment to Delhi amounted to US$ 108.27 billion between April 2000 and December 2021. In 2021, seven Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandums (IEMs) with proposed investments worth US$ 120.66 million were filed in Delhi.[^15]

Located in the northern part of the Haryana State, Gurgaon (Gurugram) is a major city in the NCR. The city is popularly known as “Cyber City” and “Millennium City” as a number of IT companies are located there. In the past few years, the city has witnessed substantial growth in the economy with the rise of information technology, ITeS, pharmaceuticals and automobile industries. Many multinational companies have their branches in Gurgaon as it is considered an ideal place to operate businesses.[^16] Gurgaon is home to corporate giants such as Microsoft, Oracle, American Express, IBM, Price Waterhouse Coopers, McKinsey and Company, Google, Dell, Ericsson and Motorola. It is also the manufacturing base of the Maruti Suzuki and Hero Honda groups.[^17]

Another major city in the NCR is Ghaziabad, located in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Primarily known as a manufacturing city, Ghaziabad has seen major growth in its business and economy due to the development of infrastructure and educational facilities, as well industrial sectors such as IT, ITeS, oil, gas, textile and heavy machinery.[^18]

Noida, a satellite city of Delhi is another major city in the NCR. Located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Noida is an important centre for trade and commerce. Over the past few decades, the city has seen phenomenal growth in its industry, infrastructure and overall economy. It is considered the education and software hub of northern India with reputed educational institutions and universities offering world-class education and a large number of MNCs making Noida their base. It is one of the largest IT and outsourcing hubs of the country. The close proximity to the national capital and great connectivity via both road and metro has made Noida a preferred business location.[^19]

### **Tourism**

Delhi has a rich and diverse culture. The city is home to magnificent monuments, museums and art galleries that contribute to a thriving cultural scene, which, when coupled with its many eateries and bustling markets, provide a wholesome tourist experience.  Besides the usual attractions such as the India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament House – which are stunning examples of British architecture – museums, temples and memorials provide a fascinating insight into the culture of Delhi.[^21]

Temples in Delhi are known not only for their religious significance, but also for their experimental designs that challenge conventional architecture. For example, the Lotus Temple built by followers of the Bahai faith, is in the shape of a blooming lotus and draws thousands of tourists each day.[^22]

New Delhi is also home to memorials of famous freedom fighters and national leaders. The Raj Ghat, Shanti Van and Shakti Sthal are the resting places of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi respectively. Others include the Teen Murti Bhavan (Nehru Memorial Museum), Gandhi Smriti and Indira Gandhi Memorial.[^23]

Tourist attractions in Gurgaon include the Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary, an ideal place for ardent bird watchers and bird lovers. Home to over 100 species of birds, the sanctuary also houses hideouts, watch towers and a museum. Popular with pilgrims of all religions and faiths is the Sheetala Devi Temple in Gurgaon. The Damdama Lake, south of Gurgaon, offers picnic spots, boating and hot air balloon rides.[^24]

 

### **Singapore and NCR**

In August 2016, Temasek Holdings-backed Ascendas-Singbridge, one of the leading sustainable urban and business space solutions providers, announced the opening of International Tech Park Gurgaon (ITPG), an integrated IT park within the upcoming business district in the NCR. The 60-acre ITPG will provide eight million square feet of international standard business space when fully developed, complete with social amenities that can cater to an estimated 60,000 professionals. Besides a unique environment-friendly infrastructure, the park will also offer spacious food courts and conveniences such as banking, transport and covered parking spaces.[^25] Mr Tan Soon Kim, assistant CEO of IE Singapore, said, “India’s demand for infrastructure development presents immense business opportunities in urban and infrastructure solutions for Singapore companies. Ascendas-Singbridge’s ITPG represents a significant entry into North India by a Singapore company and acts as a good platform for Singapore SMEs to access opportunities in Haryana and its surrounding regions.”[^26]
