### **Introduction**

The National Capital Region (NCR) of India is a unique example of inter-state regional planning and development, covering the entire National Capital Territory of Delhi, 13 districts of the State of Haryana, seven districts of the State of Uttar Pradesh and two districts of the State of Rajasthan, with New Delhi, the nation’s capital as its core.[^8] The NCR and the associated NCR Planning Board were created in 1985 to plan the development of the region and to enact harmonised policies for the control of land use and development of infrastructure in the region so as to avoid any haphazard development of the region.[^9] The NCR Planning Board’s Regional Plan 2021 aims to promote economic growth and develop the entire NCR as a region of global excellence.[^10]

### **Economy profile**

The National Capital Region has over the past decade, emerged as one of the foremost economic centres in India. It contributes significantly to India’s growth, accounting for about seven to eight percent of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP).[^11] The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) growth of Delhi was 8.1 percent in 2017. That year, the services sector contributed 85 percent to the state economy. This was followed by manufacturing at 12 percent and agriculture at three percent.[^12]

The government of Delhi is committed towards creating a progressive business environment. As per the new Industrial Policy for Delhi 2010-21, the government is keen on developing and promoting the high-tech, sophisticated, knowledge-based IT and ITeS industries in the state. The government has planned to set up a “Centre of Excellence” to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in the sectors to achieve this aim.[^13]

According to the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), FDI inflows in Delhi, including part of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, stood at US$ 74.150 billion from April 2000 to September 2017. The state government allocated a plan outlay of US$ 340.5 million for the development of the energy sector in the state and US$ 483.1 million was allocated to housing and urban development in 2017-18.[^14]

Located in the northern part of the Haryana State, Gurgaon (Gurugram) is a major city in the NCR. The city is popularly known as “Cyber City” and “Millennium City” as a number of IT companies are located there. In the past few years, the city has witnessed a substantial growth in the economy with the rise of information technology, ITeS, pharmaceuticals and automobile industries. Many multi-national companies have their branches in Gurgaon considering it a best place to operate business.[^15] Gurgaon is home to many global giants such as Microsoft, Oracle, American Express, IBM, Price Waterhouse Coopers, McKinsey and Company, Google, Dell, Ericsson and Motorola. It is also the manufacturing base of the Maruti Suzuki and Hero Honda groups.[^16]

Ghaziabad’s economic growth is attributed to its many industries, especially the steel sector. More than 500 steel organisations in Ghaziabad employ about 25,000 people. The manufacturing sector makes up 53 percent of non-agricultural jobs in Ghaziabad. The manufacturing industry is credited with an income that is eight times the income of other industries put together.[^17]

 

### **Tourism**

Delhi, once the seat of empires, has a rich and diverse culture. The city is home to magnificent monuments, museums and art galleries that contribute to a thriving cultural scene, and the many eateries and bustling markets provide a wholesome tourist experience.[^18] Besides the usual tourist attractions like the India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament House, that are stunning examples of British architecture, museums, temples and memorials provide a fascinating insight into the culture of Delhi.[^19]

Temples in Delhi are known not only for their religious significance, but also for their experimental designs that challenge conventional architectural standards. For example, the Lotus Temple built by followers of the Bahai faith, is in the shape of a blooming lotus and draws thousands of tourists each day.

New Delhi is home to memorials of famous freedom fighters and national leaders. The Raj Ghat, Shanti Van and Shakti Sthal are the resting places of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi respectively. Others include the Teen Murti Bhavan (Nehru Memorial Museum), Gandhi Smriti and Indira Gandhi Memorial.[^20]

Tourist attractions in Gurgaon include the Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary, an ideal place for ardent bird watchers and bird lovers. Home to over 100 species of birds, the sanctuary is also home to hideouts, watch towers and a museum. The Sheetala Devi Temple in Gurgaon is visited by a large number of pilgrims of all religions and faiths. The Damdama Lake, south of Gurgaon, offers picnic spots, boating and rides on hot air balloons.[^21]

 

### **Singapore and NCR**

In August 2016, Temasek Holdings-backed Ascendas-Singbridge, one of the leading sustainable urban and business space solutions provider, announced the opening of International Tech Park Gurgaon (ITPG), an integrated IT park within the upcoming business district in the NCR. The 60-acre ITPG will provide eight million square feet of international standard business space when fully developed, complete with social amenities that can cater to an estimated 60,000 professionals. Besides a unique environment-friendly infrastructure, the park will also offer spacious food courts and conveniences such as banking, transport and covered parking spaces.[^22] Mr Tan Soon Kim, Assistant CEO of IE Singapore, said: “India’s demand for infrastructure development presents immense business opportunities in urban and infrastructure solutions for Singapore companies. Ascendas-Singbridge’s ITPG represents a significant entry into North India by a Singapore company and acts as a good platform for Singapore SMEs to access opportunities in Haryana and its surrounding regions.”[^23]
