On 4 May 2018, Managing Director of ULearning Technology (International) Mr Joseph Chong shared about his experience working in China and the opportunities in China’s education market.

He cited a Chinese saying, 先做人后做事 (in other words, to be good and conduct oneself well before doing everything) and emphasised the importance of respect and sincere cultivation of relationships in China and how these would be useful values to keep in mind when one considers living and working in the country.

During the talk, Joseph further gave an overview of the trends and opportunities in China’s education sector, highlighting policies such as the “13th Five-Year Plan” for the development of national education (2016–2020), and the Artificial Intelligence Innovation Action Plan in colleges and universities, which have given rise to new prospects in the education industry. Besides policies, he also shared five possible trends to look out for in China:

- artificial intelligence (AI)
- blockchain
- collaboration
- speed of change
- emerging Asia economies like China, India and ASEAN countries

To seize the opportunities in China, Joseph recommended those who are keen to connect and collaborate with their Chinese counterparts as a first exploratory step. For students, he encouraged them to be involved in internship programmes in China to gain exposure.

This is one of the talks under the Eye on Asia programme series for everyone including young Singaporeans who want to explore opportunities in the region and beyond.
