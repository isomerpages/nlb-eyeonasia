It also supports high-tech startups by helping them source for working capital and funding, as well as connections to mentors.[^13]

Hangzhou is home to a number of major e-commerce players in the Chinese market and is challenging Shenzhen and Beijing for the title of “China’s Silicon Valley”.[^14] It is the hometown of the Alibaba Group, the country’s largest B2B online portal.[^15] The company has a market capitalisation of US$264.9 billion as at May 2017.[^16] The other major e-commerce player based in Hangzhou is Net Ease.[^17]

In 2015, the industrial sector contributed 45 percent to the city’s GDP of RMB 800.36 billion. The main industries in Ningbo are petrochemicals, chemicals, electrical machinery, telecom equipment manufacturing, IT and port-related activities.[^20]

Tourism is also an important source of revenue for Ningbo. Its numerous historical temples and lakes are a hit with tourists from all over the world.[^21]

ZJU collaborates with the Singapore University of Technology and Design in the areas of education, student exchange and research. The former is responsible for developing the curriculum and teaching five modules: sustainability of ancient Chinese architectural design in the modern world; culture formation and innovative design; business culture and entrepreneurship in China; the role of technology design on growth in China; and the history of urban development in China.[^31]

Additionally, ZJU has student exchange programmes with the National University of Singapore[^32] and Singapore Management University.[^33]



### **Singapore and Zhejiang**

The Singapore-Zhejiang Economic and Trade Council was established on 18 November 2003 to promote economic exchanges and cooperation between Zhejiang and Singapore. In the early years, both sides focused mainly on real estate, manufacturing and encouraging the province’s privately owned enterprises to list on the Singapore Exchange. Since then, the focus has expanded to include modern services such as township planning, education, transport, logistics and tourism.[^34] By December 2016, there were 1,157 Singapore projects in Zhejiang. The investments are mainly in real-estate development, auto-parts industry and general equipment manufacturing in cities such as Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhoushan, Shaoxing and Yiwu. In 2016 alone, 170 companies from the province invested a total of US$1.94 billion in Singapore.[^35]
