### **Singapore and Jiangsu**

The Singapore-Jiangsu Cooperation Council (SJCC) was officially launched on 1 November 2007. Beyond trade and economics, the council was formed to focus on forging partnerships in areas including education, tourism, and science and technology. The Jiangsu Scholarship Programme provides talented Jiangsu students the opportunity to study in Singapore, providing valuable human capital for both Jiangsu and Singapore. Since SJCC’s inception, bilateral trade between Singapore and Jiangsu has grown from US$9.1 billion in 2007 to US$9.8 billion in 2016. Singapore’s cumulative actual investments in Jiangsu exceeded US$27 billion in September 2017.[^18] Singapore-Jiangsu trade accounted for about 10 percent of Singapore-China trade, rising 13.2 percent year-on-year to reach US$8.1 billion in the first three quarters of 2017. Among the Singapore firms operating there include BLOCK71, Boardroom, CapitaLand, Global eTrade Services (GeTS), NUS Enterprise and Rajah & Tann.[^19]

At the 11th SJCC meeting held in Suzhou on 23 November 2017, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minister for Finance highlighted that Singapore companies stood to capture greater trade flows and opportunities in professional services, innovation and urban renewal as Singapore partnered with Jiangsu province, the biggest economy in East China. Minister Heng further added that the Belt and Road Initiative would drive trade and economic cooperation, and catalyse the internationalisation of Chinese enterprises. This would bring increased trade flows and for Singapore and Jiangsu enterprises to jointly expand into Southeast Asia. There was also room to work together in innovation and technology partnerships as both Singapore and Jiangsu placed greater focus on innovation and R&D efforts to transform their economies and to drive growth.[^20]

On 31 May 2018, Singapore and Nanjing agreed to deepen collaboration, with seven Singapore companies and an educational institution inking deals in clean technology, logistics and innovation. The memorandums of understanding (MOUs), which involved projects amounting to US$230.25 million were signed at the sixth Singapore-Nanjing Special Projects Cooperation Panel (SNCP) meeting. The SNCP, established in 2013, is the only city-level cooperation platform that Singapore has with China, and aims to boost cooperation through special projects, and comes under the SJCC. Three of the MOUs involved projects on the Singapore-Nanjing Eco Hi-Tech Island (SNEHTI), a provincial-level development zone supported by the Singapore, Jiangsu and Nanjing governments.[^21]
