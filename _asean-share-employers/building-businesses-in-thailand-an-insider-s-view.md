*Eng-Lok Koh, Vice-President and Country Manager of Frost & Sullivan Thailand, gives us an insider’s view on on-ground business sentiments and shares his view on opportunities in Thailand.*

*“COVID-19 has shaken up the industries in Thailand, exerting an uneven effect across the industries. Sectors that depend heavily on tourism, such as the hospitality sectors like health and wellness, hotels, resort islands, retail and F&B have been hit the hardest. Construction, aerospace and manufacturing are badly hurt as well. Even international schools are affected as expatriates lose their jobs and move home with their children.”*

*However, Eng Lok stresses that amidst the economic doom and gloom, certain sectors have emerged as bright spots in the Thai economy.*

*“Thailand’s transformational health, chemical, materials & food and ICT industries are benefiting from the fallout. In particular, ICT companies providing conferencing solutions, e-commerce companies and online food delivery platforms like Line MAN, Food Panda and Grab Food have seen accelerated growth in business.”*
