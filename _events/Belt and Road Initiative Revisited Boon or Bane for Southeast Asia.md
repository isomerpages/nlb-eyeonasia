Trade and investment is a two-way street. Investments in ASEAN countries have commonly been discussed, but how has the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) improved the volume of trade and investment from ASEAN to China? How can we capitalise on the opportunities arising from BRI and navigate the rising geopolitical tensions in the region? Likewise, how has China’s view of BRI in Southeast Asia changed and what are their considerations?

As we commemorate the 30th anniversary of ASEAN-China relations this year, learn more about how the BRI ties into these relations, and the BRI’s effects on Southeast Asia.
