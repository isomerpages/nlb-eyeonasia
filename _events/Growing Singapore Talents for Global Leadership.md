As more growth opportunities arise in Asia and the ASEAN region, Singapore is well-positioned to be a hub for foreign businesses and investments, as well as promising young enterprises across emerging sectors. Thus, there is a need to accelerate the development of Singapore talents for global leadership roles. Join us for a panel discussion on the talent landscape in Singapore and the region, how local talents have benefited from overseas immersion and international exposure, and how key stakeholders can play a role in building a robust talent pipeline for global leadership roles.
