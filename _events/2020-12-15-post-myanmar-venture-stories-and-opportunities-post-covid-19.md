With a mostly young working and energetic population of over 54 million people and brimming with opportunities, Myanmar has been dubbed as “Southeast Asia’s last frontier economy”. What makes her attractive and what shifts and adjustments should we expect in a post-pandemic Myanmar economy? 

Be inspired by our panel of Singaporean entrepreneurs as they share their battleground stories and candid perspectives on venturing into Myanmar, adapting to a challenging new environment, and finding success and purpose.

**Lester Chua**<br>
**Rajah & Tann, Partner**

Lester has been working in Myanmar since 2016. He oversees the disputes practice at Rajah & Tann's Myanmar office, and also advises clients on various aspects of their investments in Myanmar, including setting up businesses, employment, regulatory compliance and licensing. Lester has been working remotely from Singapore since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and he misses the awesome avocado milkshakes from Tianhao's Hejohejo shops in Myanmar very much.

Based in Myanmar for the past seven years, Tianhao is currently the Business Development Partner at Quantum HR. He also oversees the operations at Ocha Bubble Tea, which has 13 outlets across Myanmar. His constant source of motivation is being able to provide memorable food for his good friends like Lester.

Zhen Han previously worked for Morgan Stanley in investment banking, with a focus on equity capital markets. He joined his family’s business in Myanmar at the beginning of 2019 and now manages four main portfolios, namely eGovernment, lighting, properties and hospitality. Missing home, he finds solace in good food from people like Tianhao and the many other Singaporeans who remained in Myanmar during the pandemic.
