Technology and globalisation has facilitated collaborations across borders to take place around the world, giving rise to innovative ideas and new possibilities, often even without the need to travel. What does co-innovation look like today, where do opportunities lie, and what can we do to create value, whether as fresh graduates, entrepreneurs or business developers?

Our speakers will provide their insights and thoughts from their experiences in venture building, R&amp;D, product development and much more. Learn about co-innovation in Singapore, China, Thailand and Vietnam from our experts in this panel discussion.
