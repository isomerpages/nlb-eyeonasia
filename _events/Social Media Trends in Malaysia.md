With social media taking everyone and everything by storm, it has become essential to understand how the various social media platforms work, the audiences that use them, and the topics that fuel meaningful (and sometimes heated) discourse, in order to make better sense of the issues taking place around us.

Join WeirdKaya’s Sarah Yeoh and Headline Media’s Chan Jin Wen as they share:

- An overview of Malaysia’s social media platforms and target audiences

- How social media is used to form public opinion

- “Sensitive” / thought-provoking topics among Malaysian social media users

- The role of social media in content marketing
