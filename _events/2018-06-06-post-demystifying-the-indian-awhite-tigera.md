On 6 June 2018, the Eye on Asia programme series held its first talk on India with two speakers – Mr James Tan, a professional from the aviation industry and Mr Lalit Jagtiani, author of When Change Happens … A Story of Organisational Transformation.

Mr Jagtiani opened the session with a candid overview of India’s diversified cultures and environment from a local’s perspective. He provided an understanding of the unique characteristics of Indians as well as the traits of Indian professionals. For example, he cited a Thirupathi barber, who shaved off a small portion of a customer’s hair and went off to find other customers. Hence, the customer was forced to wait for the barber to return and complete the job. Likewise, the locals tend to complete one part of the job first and leave to find other customers. This results in a situation where companies have to wait for them to come back to finish the job.

The second speaker, Mr Tan, touched on the similarities and differences between India and Singapore such as a shared colonial heritage. As a Singaporean who lived and worked in India with a local team, Mr Tan further shared interesting experiences on housing, food, transportation as well as encouraged those seeking opportunities in India to keep an open mind, compromise when needed and blend in with the local community.

During the question-and-answer session, varied questions were put forth by the audience like the emerging industries in India, how to prepare oneself before going there, how to negotiate with the local companies and lessons which Singaporeans could learn from India.

This is one of the talks under the Eye on Asia programme series for everyone including young Singaporeans who want to explore opportunities in the region and beyond.

**Wednesday, 6 June 2018**

**7.00 pm – 8.30 pm**

**Level 5, Possibility Room**

**National Library Building**

Sharing in their personal capacities and drawing upon literary, cultural and anecdotal experiences, Singaporean **James Tan** and India-born **Lalit Jagtiani** present a contemporary perspective of India from the inside looking out and outside looking in.

Their aim is not to provide definitive answers about India today, but rather to raise candid questions and points of deliberation for a meaningful post-presentation discussion, to allow participants to form their own conclusions about the country.
