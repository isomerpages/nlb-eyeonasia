Venture into India where opportunities are aplenty! This was the common call by both speakers, Mr Krishna Veerapan, Project Management Consultant at Bandar Iskandar Johor Bahru & Principal Mediator at Singapore International Mediation Institute and Mr Vikas Goel, Vice President of Investment at Agrud Advisors during the Eye on Asia programme on 4 September 2018.

The session kicked off with Krishna who shared his experiences in managing a container yard and warehouse project in Bombay. Establishing a good relationship with the project team was key to his success and the first thing he did was to spend time and effort engaging with the managers and engineers at the site. For those considering project management work in India, he emphasised the importance of monitoring its progress and the need to ensure that the standards are met. He further suggested that contractors and authorities may be best managed by the locals as they will be more familiar with the processes in India. Finally, Krishna encouraged the audience to venture into India where there are many business and investment opportunities in high demand areas like cold storage facilities, factories and hotels.

The second speaker, Vikas gave an overview of the industries in India where opportunities are aplenty for companies to bring in innovative solutions for sectors such as agricultural and rural development, renewable energy and financial technology. While he highlighted several challenges for conducting businesses in India like the highly competitive environment and stiff price competition, Vikas shared that Singapore companies could also consider tapping the labour supply in India for production work as the Singapore office manages the other aspects of the businesses.

This is one of the talks under the Eye on Asia programme series for everyone including young Singaporeans who want to explore opportunities in the region and beyond.
