The population grew 1.9 percent, an increase from the 33.5 million recorded in 2023. The population of males outnumbers that of females: in 2020, the gender ratio is 1.11 male to one female. The Malaysian population comprises many ethnic groups. In 2020, more than 69 percent of the population were Bumiputera, which included Malays, Orang Asli, and Sabah and Sarawak natives.[^12]

### **Economic profile**

Malaysia’s economy grew at a moderate rate of 3.6 percent in 2023, attaining a gross domestic product (GDP) of MYR1.82 trillion. Growth was led by the services sector and manufacturing sector, which accounted for 82.6 percent of total GDP. The country’s GDP per capita fell slightly from MYR53,121 in 2022 to MYR53,026 in 2019.[^13]

### **Industry**

Malaysia’s services industry grew by 5.1 percent from the previous year in 2023, led by wholesale and retail trade, transportation &amp; storage, and food &amp; beverage sub-sectors.[^15]

The manufacturing industry became a significant contributor to the country’s economy in the post-independence period beginning in the 1960s.[^16] In 2023, the manufacturing industry recorded a slower 0.7 percent growth. Leading Malaysia’s manufacturing industry is the motor vehicles &amp; transport equipment, food processing, and fabricated metal products sub-sectors.[^17]

Other sectors such as agriculture, mining &amp; quarrying, and construction are other sectors contributing largely to Malaysia's GDP. [^18]

### **Tourism**

Malaysia’s attractions include towering skyscrapers, rugged mountains, sandy beaches and cool highland hideaways.[^19] The Petronas Twin Towers, also known as KLCC, is an iconic 88-storey twin building located in the capital Kuala Lumpur and is a popular tourist photography spot.[^20] Mount Kinabalu, located in Sabah, is the highest mountain in Southeast Asia, standing at 4,095 metres and well-known for its botanical and biological species biodiversity.[^21] Malaysia is also home to many beautiful islands such as Pulau Tioman and Pulau Sipadan, which are popular among snorkelers and divers. Its diverse culture also makes the country a “gastronomical paradise” which attracts visitors.[^22]

In 2023, tourism brought 28.9 million international tourist arrivals who contributed MYR275.8 billion (or 15.1 percent) to the country’s GDP.[^23] Tourist arrivals in 2023 were dominated by visitors from Singapore with 18.85 million arrivals, followed by Indonesia (4.14 million arrivals) and China (3.72 million arrivals).[^24]
